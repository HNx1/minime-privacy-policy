# MiniMe Privacy Policy

## Summary
MiniMe is designed to personalize LLM applications. To do so, we collect data that you directly give us about your preferences, store it, then retrieve it for you to use in LLM applications. The only personal data we store is that which you directly input into the MiniMe application

## Identity
We store a Google id number, generated by Google for your account, and use it to allow you access to your data from our server. This id number cannot be used to identify you personally without access to your Google account. We do not store your email address, name or other directly identifying data.

## Location
We use the Chrome geolocation permission to access your current longitude and latitude. If you opt in, you can use this data in personalized LLM prompts. We do not store or otherwise use your location data.

## Downstream Privacy
If you send your data to a model provider like OpenAI after using our service, that data is then subject to their privacy policies. We cannot protect it there and you must be aware of who you are sending it to.

## Integrations
All our enterprise integrations will be opt-in and can be revoked at any time.

## Account Deletion
Account deletion is permanent and we remove all your personal data from our server immediately.
